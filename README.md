# Tic-Tac-Toe
Project 1
The briefest description of my cool project and why you should all use it.

## :computer: [Click here](#) to see my live project!

## :page_facing_up: About
- tic-tac-toe game using colors pink = X and blue = O
- X always goes first
- if game ends in draw restart browser and try again


## :pencil2: Planning & Problem Solving
- was a difficult prject for me to get the outcomes i wanted to happen actually happen 
- spent alot of time on my winning combinations and what should happen if a win or draw.

## :rocket: Cool tech
- when there is a win computer knows it :wink:
- Anything else you'd be proud to show your parents :fire: :ok_hand:

## :scream: Bugs to fix :poop:
- draw sometimes doesnt work when person wins on last move :sweat_drops:

## :sob: Lessons learnt :godmode:
What I would do differently if I could wind back the clock...
 - i would make this whole project the  same way i have created it but i would do it in a shorter amount of time :fist:
## :white_check_mark: Future features
Cool things I would add if I can keep working on this
 - will turn the colours to X and O
 - and create a winning animation
